# airfare

*Project Overview*

By analyzing data from the US department of transportation I aim to understand why airfare prices change and the factors that influence them. we'll explore how city distances and airline choices affect ticket prices.

 
 *Motivation:*
 
I have chosen this project because of my interest in airplane ticket prices. I want to explore how the distances between cities and airline effects the prices of tickets.
 
*Challenges and Approach:*

 The data I originally choose consisted of multiple tables that was aggregated by quarters. I wanted data that was more granular. Also, some challenges occurred with finalizing what data I wanted to include. 


*Data Source and tools:*

The data I chose was from the U.S dept of Transpotation. [here]( https://www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/domestic-airline-consumer-airfare-report.).

The tools used are:

- Python for general data handling.
- Shiny
